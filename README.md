# Zomato Ratings effectiveness analysis
The project focuses on 900 restaurants listed on Zomato across 13 metropolitan cities of India. The business is B2C and deals in the segment of providing online food delivery and restaurant reservation services directly to end consumers.
The major business issues that the organization is facing are related to identifying customer preferences, restaurant preference evaluation across cities, market segmentation, targeting, and devising effective pricing strategies.
The issues will be addressed by analyzing the data via different analytical approaches to obtain a fruitful outcome. The approach is mainly in the form of Exploratory Data Analysis, which involves comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, statistical analysis on variables like ratings, reviews, cuisines, prices and location, and data visualization techniques like histogram, scatter plots, to identify patterns, trends and ay outliers in the data.
The expected outcome will help the organization optimize their business model, and have a better understanding of consumer preferences, along with the market dynamics, delivery logistics as well as marketing strategies.
